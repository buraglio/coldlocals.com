I have a lot of energy.  When I was younger I didn&#8217;t really know how to channel it, skateboarding solved a lot of that for me and the vast majority of it went into skateboarding for a large number of years, but even with that outlet I could still get amped up and be that annoying kid that never stopped moving.  I was (and pretty much still am) a corn cob from the [middle of Illinois][1].  Growing up in a town of less tan 10,000 residents, the world seemed huge for a good long time.  Chicago seemed so far away, it was 3 hours north and I pretty much never went there.

Until the early 1990s.  I think the following occurred around 1992, but it&#8217;s a bit hazy at this point.

I was always, and still am, a big Matt Hensley fan.  He proved that anyone could skate street. He seemed approachable and to me appeared as if  didn&#8217;t care about anything but skating.  I could relate to that.  He was a purist, using the board to do what needed done with it; skate the streets for the simple reason that it could be done.  It needed done.  It&#8217;s how I felt about skating: it was a direct conduit to myself.  I never cared about the fashon or the politics or the brands.  It was about the curb, the rail, the gap or the stairs. Nothing else.

When I got that opportunity to go to Chicago all I cared about was going to the sessions skate shop.  Hensley worked there and it was new turf for me.  Unfortunately, when I got there I was so amped up from being in a car that long I couldn&#8217;t contain myself. I was all over that place, being loud and obnoxious and a textbook annoying turd.  I knew it, they new it, my friends knew it., but I just couldn&#8217;t contain my excitement.  I knocked over a big rack of clothing and who of all people should kick me out of the sessions skate shop?

Matt Hensley.  [<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64" src="http://coldlocals.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/matt-hensley.jpg" alt="matt-hensley" width="554" height="800" />][2]

Yup, the I had straight up pissed off the person I wanted to meet.  I never even got a chance to talk to him, he ejected me right out of the shop and I had to wait outside while my friends finished up.  I saw him at a Flogging Molly show 10 or so years ago but didn&#8217;t say anything.  Lesson learned all of 20+ years later.

As I tell the story now it seems a bit funny.
