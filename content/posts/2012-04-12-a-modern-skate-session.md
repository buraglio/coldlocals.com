A few years ago I got my board out again. I was in my driveway, at age 34. I&#8217;m 37 as of the time of this writing. I wanted to see if I could still do any tricks, or even just kick around without falling down. A few of my old pals, and cold local alums didn&#8217;t believe I could still do anything any more, let alone stick a few tricks. This poor video is the result&#8230;I was able to do a few kickflips and shove-its, and overall I felt pretty comfortable aside from the normal achs and pains of getting older having beat the crap out of your body for 20 years stuff&#8230;. There was no warm up, this was right as I stepped on the board. &#8230;&#8230;After this my back hurt so bad I had to take 4 Advil.
