In 1989, the skateboarders in Clinton and Wapella, IL got their hands on a video camera. Over a few days that summer, we filmed what later came to be known as &#8220;Garbage Pile&#8221;, or &#8220;Ryan&#8217;s Bare Ass&#8221;.
  
This is the resulting product. Before any judgement is passed and comments are thrown up, bear in mind that this was 1989, in Clinton, IL, a 8000 person town in the middle of a corn field. There was no internet, no youtube, no simple way to learn tricks outside of a magazine. There was no reasonable way to edit this video, it was all done in camera.
