A lot has happened in recent months. Nearly all of the original skateboarders from my home town have reconnected and many have actually started skating again. Because skateboarding is something near and very dear to me, I have kicked it up a notch and tried re-learning some tricks as well as began to really smooth out the stuff I used to really love to do. To that end, here is a rough cut of an evening of me, at age 42, skating on a particularly warm Winter evening in Illinois. 

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%">

</div>

Stay Tuned. There will be more from all of the Cold Locals.
