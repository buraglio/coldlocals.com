While I was looking for a shirt to wear in my &#8220;overflow closet&#8221; (where all of my old stuff that I can&#8217;t bear to toss out goes) I came across this <a href="http://www.santacruzskateboards.com/" target="_blank">Santa Cruz Skateboards</a> long sleeve shirt from ~1991.  I had completely forgotten I had it since I don&#8217;t believe I had actually purchased it myself. If memory serves, this actually belongs to one <a href="https://twitter.com/seanmholland" target="_blank">Sean Holland</a> of <a href="http://www.neutralaccentsfanzine.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">Neutral Accents Fanzine</a> fame from the second location (basement) of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShockwavesSkateshop" target="_blank">Shockwaves Skate shop</a> in Bloomington-Normal, IL of which I was the first customer; my dollar was still on the wall when I was there last; I bought a <a href="http://spitfirewheels.com/formulafour/" target="_blank">spitfire wheels</a> shirt&#8230;..hmmm, I wonder where that is.    It&#8217;s even got &#8220;slam scars&#8221;.
