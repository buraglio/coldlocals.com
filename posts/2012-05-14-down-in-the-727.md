I happened to be down in Clinton (the 727, since the zip code is 61727) recently. Â I as we drove around and went to get some of my favorite pizza from <a href="http://www.sorrentosclinton.com/" target="_blank">Sorrentos Pizza</a> (one of my former employers in a past life asnd a Clinton institution), I noticed, quite by chance, a lone skateboarder heading down the street doing ollies over the same manhole covers that I ollied over 25 years ago.   
It made me feel very nostalgic and dare I say proud, to realize that 25 years ago, we planted that seed.   
Prior to that, there had not been any modern skateboarding in Clinton. 

I don&#8217;t think I ever want to live there again, but I must admit, it still really feels like home.
