I was walking around UIUC campus last week during a particularly warm March day and  I saw a guy dressed completely in maroon clothing.  Pants, short, shoes.  All maroon.  While this wouldn&#8217;t have really been a mentionable thing, he was sticking some slick k-grinds and lipslides on a heat return/planter thing.  I watched for about 10 minutes and was envious that his knees didn&#8217;t hurt. 

That is all.
