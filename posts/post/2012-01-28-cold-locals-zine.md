Cold locals was, and is, one of the things I&#8217;m most proud of. It signifies the best of times in a kids life. Doing something you love and making something to show for it. I had totally forgotten that I even made this until a few years ago when I found the proofs in a box in storage. Honestly, I got a bit misty and choked up looking through it. This was shot , edited and copied in Clinton, IL by myself and B.J. Obermeyer. The entirity of the &#8216;zine can be found [here][1]. Cold Locals represents a purity, love and desire that one loses when they become an adult. This is what life is about. Regardless of the perceived quality, I have more pride in this than in almost anything else I&#8217;ve ever done.

    </center>I had shirts and sweatshirts made, mostly because I wanted a few of my own. I make no profit from these, they were simply done so I could have one. Through the magic and wonder that is the internet, I had nearly instant gratification. A <a href="http://tinyurl.com/87fo5d">Short Sleeved T- Shirt</a>, a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/a9cwbu">long sleeved T-Shirt</a>, and even the always stylish <a href="http://tinyurl.com/8gn979">hooded sweatshirt</a>. Now you can show your colors if you were a Clinton or Wapella, Illinois skateboarder from the early days.
